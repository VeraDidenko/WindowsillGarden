        <p class="about">
            Have you ever dreamed of having a garden of your own, but didn't have the place for one, live in the city, or don't have
            strength or health for gardening work? Well, you can have it on your windowsill! It doesn't have to be big, you can make
            it as big as you want (or as big as your windowsill will allow it).

            One kind of windowsill garden that you can create is a succulent garden. Succulents are plants, including cactus. They can grow almost anywhere,
            even in the tiniest places. In fact, some succulents grow as much as you give their roots room. You can grow your favourite succulents right on your windowsill.
            You can arrange them in many different ways. It is all up to you. Succulents not only can decorate your home, but they are bring
            huge benefits.
