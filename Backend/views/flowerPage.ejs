            <p class="about">
                Have you ever dreamed of having a garden of your own, but didn't have the place for one, live in the city, or don't have
                strength or health for gardening work? Well, you can have it on your windowsill! It doesn't have to be big, you can make
                it as big as you want (or as big as your windowsill will allow it).

                One kind of windowsill garden that you can create is a flower garden. You can grow your favourite flowers right on your windowsill.
                You can arrange them in many different ways. It is all up to you.
